Puppet fails to perform tasks which rely on Augeas.  The default Ruby version in Cumulus Linux is 1.9.1, but the version of libaugeas-ruby on the Cumulus 2.5 repository is version 1.8.

The following errors occur:


Package libaugeas-ruby1.9.1 is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source

E: Package 'libaugeas-ruby1.9.1' has no installation candidate

Package augeas-tools is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source

E: Package 'augeas-tools' has no installation candidate
